# ðŸ“š PLP Bookstore â€“ MongoDB Fundamentals (Week 1 Assignment)

## ðŸ—‚ Project Overview

This repository contains the completed tasks for **Week 1: MongoDB â€“ Data Layer Fundamentals and Advanced Techniques** as part of the Power Learn Project curriculum.

The focus is on mastering the fundamentals of MongoDB including CRUD operations, advanced queries, aggregation pipelines, and indexing â€” using a bookstore data model.

---

## âœ… Tasks Completed

### 1. MongoDB Setup
- âœ… MongoDB installed locally.
- âœ… Created database: `plp_bookstore`.
- âœ… Created collection: `books`.

### 2. Basic CRUD Operations
- âœ… Inserted at least 10 book documents using `insert_books.js`.
- âœ… All book documents include the following fields:
  - `title` (string)
  - `author` (string)
  - `genre` (string)
  - `published_year` (number)
  - `price` (number)
  - `in_stock` (boolean)
  - `pages` (number)
  - `publisher` (string)
- âœ… Performed queries for:
  - Books in a specific genre
  - Books published after a certain year
  - Books by a specific author
  - Price update for a specific book
  - Deleting a book by title

### 3. Advanced Queries
- âœ… Queried books in stock and published after 2010.
- âœ… Used projection to return only `title`, `author`, and `price`.
- âœ… Sorted books by price (ascending and descending).
- âœ… Implemented pagination using `limit()` and `skip()` (5 books per page).

### 4. Aggregation Pipelines
- âœ… Calculated average book price by genre.
- âœ… Identified the author with the most books.
- âœ… Grouped books by publication decade and counted them.

### 5. Indexing and Performance Optimization
- âœ… Created a single-field index on `title`.
- âœ… Created a compound index on `author` and `published_year`.
- âœ… Used `explain()` and `hint()` to analyze and compare query performance with and without indexes.

## ðŸ›  Setup & Usage Instructions

### i. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd week-1-mongodb-fundamentals-assignment-<your-username>
```

### ii. Install Dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

### iii. Insert Book Data into MongoDB
```bash
node insert_books.js
```

### 4. Run Queries
You can run the queries inside queries.js in either:

MongoDB Shell (mongosh)

MongoDB Compass (using the built-in query tab)

Or copy/paste them individually to test in either environment.
